# AR Performance Testing Tool

Unity project folder for an AR application to record device tracking data and IMU sensor readings, environment characteristics, and user experience metrics.

Built as an additional scene (Scenes>SceneIt>PerformanceTesting) on top of the Unity AR Foundation Samples project. Existing Unity AR Foundation assets included for now for ease of adding new features.
